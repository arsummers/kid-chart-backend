# kid-chat-backend

This is going to be the back-end for the kid chart chore tracking app. Will be built in Django REST Framework, then the API will be fed to an expo front end, and deployed as a mobile app.

Basic steps:
Grab models from kid chart's vanilla Django version
Work on user stuff. Get permissions all locked down.
Deal with views and stuff.

Move to front end (maybe have one written for mobile with Expo or React Native, and one written for web with Next.js) ONLY AFTER permissions and models are all behaving the way they should.
